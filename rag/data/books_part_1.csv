3,The Lost Melody,Mira Solis,"Mira was a blind pianist who played melodies she claimed to hear in her dreams. One night, she composed a tune that made everyone in the audience cry.

4,The Vanishing Town,Daniel Hallow,"As a journalist, Daniel was used to strange stories, but nothing prepared him for Eldermoor—a town that appeared on maps once every ten years. When he arrived, the townspeople greeted him warmly, but with sadness in their eyes. As he took notes for his article, he felt a sudden dizziness. He blinked and found himself dressed in their old-fashioned clothes. His notebook lay on the ground, its pages turning to dust. Eldermoor had claimed another citizen."
5,Whispers in the Fog,Jonah Wells,"Every night, a thick fog rolled into the village, and Jonah heard whispers in a language he didn’t understand. One evening, he followed the voices to the graveyard, where he saw figures moving through the mist. An old woman appeared, whispering, 'It’s not your time yet.' The next morning, Jonah woke up in his bed, but the village was abandoned, covered in vines. A single tombstone stood outside—his own, dated a hundred years ago."
6,The Paper Kingdom,Lena Hart,"Lena loved to write stories in her notebook, each page filled with adventures and magic. But one evening, she found that the characters she created had stepped out of the pages, wandering around her room. They begged her to write an ending, as their world was falling apart. But every time she tried, the ink faded. The only way to save them was to step into the story herself. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and vanished into the pages."
7,Through the Painted Door,Leon Mercer,"Leon bought an old, dusty painting from a flea market. It depicted a door standing alone in the middle of a field. That night, the door in the painting creaked open. Curious, he touched the canvas—and was pulled inside. The next day, the painting at the flea market had changed. It now showed a man pounding on the door, screaming for help. No one heard him, and the painting was sold to another unsuspecting buyer."
8,The House That Waited,Mara Winslow,"Mara inherited an old house from a relative she never knew. From the moment she stepped inside, she felt watched.

The last entry read: 'She arrives tomorrow. The house has been waiting.'"
9,The Shadow Collector,Simon Vale,"Simon was a skilled thief, but his latest job was different. The artifact he stole wasn’t gold or jewels—it was a glass orb that held something dark inside.

As he faded into nothingness, a new shadow appeared inside the orb, waiting for the next thief to take the bait."
10,The Echo of Stars,Dr. Lillian Reeves,"Dr. Lillian spent her life searching for extraterrestrial signals. One night, her radio telescope picked up an eerie pattern. When she decoded it, she gasped.
