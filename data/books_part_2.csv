11,The Door Between Worlds,Amara Voss,"Amara had always dreamed of other worlds, but when she moved into her new apartment, she found a door that didn’t belong. It stood alone in the basement, locked tight. One night, it creaked open by itself, revealing a sky filled with swirling galaxies. She stepped through—and never returned. The door vanished the next morning, as if it had never been there."
12,The Man Who Painted Time,Hugo Barlow,"Hugo was an artist obsessed with painting moments exactly as they happened. One evening, he painted a clock with missing hands. The next day, time in his town stopped. Birds froze in midair, cars stalled, and people were trapped mid-step. The only way to restart time was to finish the painting, but he had lost his brush. And then, to his horror, he realized—he was part of the painting too."
13,The Lighthouse That Called Me,Isla Moreau,"Isla had never seen the ocean, but in her dreams, she always stood before a lighthouse, hearing its distant call. One summer, she visited a seaside town and found the exact lighthouse from her dreams. The door was unlocked, and inside, she discovered a dusty journal with her name on it. The last entry read: 'She finally came home.'"
14,The Book That Read Me,Owen Sharpe,"Owen loved collecting old books, but one night, he found one that had no title. Inside, every page was filled with moments from his own life, written in real-time. When he flipped to the last page, he saw the words: 'He turns the page and vanishes.' Trembling, he shut the book—but the next morning, he was gone. All that remained was the book, now with a new name on the cover."
15,The Forgotten Train,Eliza Dorne,"Eliza missed the last train home and decided to wait on the platform. A few minutes later, an old, rusted train arrived, even though no schedule listed it. The conductor looked at her and whispered, 'You're not supposed to be here yet.' The train vanished as she stepped back, and when she checked her phone, an hour had passed in an instant. The next day, she looked up the train—only to find reports of it disappearing fifty years ago."
16,The House of Endless Halls,Victor Langley,"Victor was a real estate agent tasked with selling an abandoned mansion. But every time he turned a corner, the halls seemed to shift. The front door disappeared, and rooms repeated endlessly. Then he found a mirror, and inside its reflection was a version of himself—only older and desperate. 'Don't make the same mistake,' the reflection pleaded. But it was too late. The house had chosen him."
17,The Girl in the Photograph,Harper Quinn,"Harper found an old photograph in a thrift store, showing a girl standing by a tree, smiling. That night, she heard whispers from the picture frame. The next morning, the girl had moved, now standing closer. The whispers grew louder. By the third night, the girl stood right in front of the frame, her hands pressed against the glass. The next morning, Harper was gone, and a new photograph appeared on the shelf—this time, with Harper inside."
18,The Silent Town,Cassius Reed,"Cassius drove through the desert and stumbled upon a town not on any map. People walked the streets, but no one spoke. The signs were blank, the radios silent. He tried to leave, but every road led back to the same street. Desperate, he screamed, and for the first time, the townspeople turned to look at him. A woman whispered, 'Now you've done it.' The world around him went black."
19,The Mapmaker’s Curse,Felix Holloway,"Felix loved drawing maps of places he had never been. One day, he sketched an island, filling in forests, rivers, and a ruined castle. That night, he received a letter with no return address: 'You have created us. Now you must rule.' The next morning, the map had changed—there were tiny figures moving in the castle. And then he felt a pull, as if something wanted him to step inside."
20,The Stranger Who Knew Me,Delilah Moore,"Delilah met a man at a café who greeted her like an old friend. 'We used to know each other,' he said, but she had no memory of him. He told her stories of their past adventures, things no stranger could know. As she listened, memories flooded back—but they weren’t hers. When she looked down at her reflection in the coffee, she gasped. It wasn’t her face looking back."
